Coding exercise provided by The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard that accesses data from the Boston transportation system website (https://mbta.com).

## Problem description

### Question 1
Write a program that retrieves data representing all, what we'll call "subway" routes: "Light Rail" (type 0) and “Heavy Rail” (type 1). The program should list their “long names” on the console.

### Question 2
Extend your program so it displays the following additional information.
1. The name of the subway route with the most stops as well as a count of its stops.
2. The name of the subway route with the fewest stops as well as a count of its stops.
3. A list of the stops that connect two or more subway routes along with the relevant route names for each of those stops.

### Question 3
Extend your program again such that the user can provide any two stops on the subway routes you listed for question 1.

List a rail route you could travel to get from one stop to the other. 

Examples:
1. Davis to Kendall -> Redline
2. Ashmont to Arlington -> Redline, Greenline
